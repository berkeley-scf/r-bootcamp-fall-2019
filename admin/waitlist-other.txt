All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 24-25 at Berkeley.
There's a small chance I will be able to let some attend from outside
of UC Berkeley, but I won't be able to give you more information until 
mid-August as cancellations come in and I work through the waitlist. 

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible in the event of last-minute
cancellations.
