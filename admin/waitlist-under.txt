All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 24-25 at Berkeley.
We give first preference to Berkeley graduate students and postdocs, 
and given high demand this year it's unlikely we'll be able to offer you a seat. 
Furthermore, I likely won't know for sure until mid-August. 

Note that for those receiving this who are undergraduates, taking
Statistics 133 is a good way to learn R and about computing with data
more generally.  In addition, the various courses in the Data Science
Education Program will teach you either Python or R as part of
learning data science, so those are good options too.
Finally the D-Lab offers training in R frequently during the fall and 
spring semesters.

Thanks,
Chris Paciorek
