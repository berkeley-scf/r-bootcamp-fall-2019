Hi all,

You are officially registered for the R bootcamp at UC Berkeley August
24-25. I'll be passing along more information as the time gets closer.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's VERY important
that you cancel your registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible. We've had overwhelming demand
this year (320 people have already filled out the registration form),
so anyone who doesn't show up will prevent someone
else from attending. So if you find out you can't make it, at any point,
please cancel your registration at https://forms.gle/itNKHw6e8wiba1uEA.

I'll provide more information later about how we'll have dual tracks during
the bootcamp, with a second track splitting off in the afternoons for those
wanting more intensive practice with some of the more introductory concepts.

Related to the above, I'll also note that the bootcamp does not assume
any prior knowledge of R, but it is fast-paced as part of an effort to
cover a fairly wide range of what is possible with R. So
for those of you who have neither done any programming (e.g., Python, C, Java,
Fortran, R, MATLAB) nor done any script-based data analysis (e.g., R,
Python, MATLAB, Stata, SAS) before, the second track may be appropriate
(you can decide during the bootcamp, no need to decide now).
In addition, if you are interested in a slower-paced training, you may want
to consider  the R trainings offered by the D-Lab throughout the fall and spring
semesters, in particular the R training the week before the bootcamp,
which is not yet advertized at http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training but should
be posted in coming weeks.

The R bootcamp is sponsored by the UC Berkeley Statistics Department, the
D-Lab and the Statewide Database at Berkeley Law.
