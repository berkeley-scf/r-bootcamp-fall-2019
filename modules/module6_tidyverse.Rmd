# Overview

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. (Dasu and Johnson, 2003)

Thus before you can even get to doing any sort of sophisticated analysis or plotting, you'll generally first need to:

1. ***Manipulating*** data frames, e.g., filtering, summarizing, and conducting calculations across groups.
2. ***Tidying*** data into the appropriate format

The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a suite of packages designed 
specifically to help with both these steps; some of which we will be introducing in this module. These are by no means the only packages out there for data wrangling but they are increasingly popular for their readable, straightforward syntax and sensible default behaviors.

# Data frame Manipulation using Base R functions

So far, you've seen the basics of manipulating data frames, e.g. subsetting, merging, and basic calculations.
For instance, we can use base R functions to calculate summary statistics across groups of observations,
e.g., the mean GDP per capita within each region:

```{r}
mean(gap[gap$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gap[gap$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gap[gap$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])
```

But this isn't ideal because it involves a fair bit of repetition. 
Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially 
introduce hard to find bugs.

# Data frame manipulation using `dplyr`

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating data frames. 
These functions will save you time and hassle by reducing repetition, and will help to make your code more human-readable (trust me: your future self and others might thank you!)

Here we're going to cover 6 of the most commonly used functions as well as using pipes (`%>%`) to combine them.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarize()`
5. `mutate()`
6. `arrange()`

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so now:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# NOT run
install.packages('dplyr')
```

Now let's load the package:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

# `dplyr::select`

Imagine that we just received the gapminder dataset, but are only interested in a few variables in it. The `select()` function can help us to keep only the columns corresponding to variables we select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp_dplyr <- select(gap, year, country, gdpPercap)
head(year_country_gdp_dplyr)
```

![](img/dplyr-fig1.png)

If we open up `year_country_gdp`, we'll see that it only contains the year, country and gdpPercap. This is equivalent to the base R subsetting function:

```{r}
year_country_gdp_base <- gap[,c("year", "country", "gdpPercap")]
head(year_country_gdp_base)
```

We can even check that these two data frames are equivalent:

```{r}
# checking equivalence: TRUE indicates an exact match between these objects
all.equal(year_country_gdp_dplyr, year_country_gdp_base)
```

But, as we will see, `dplyr` makes for much more readable, efficient code because of its *pipe* operator.

# piping with `dplyr`

![](img/magrittr_hex.png)

Above, we used what's called "normal" grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` lie 
in combining several functions using *pipes*.

In typical base R code, a simple operation might be written like: 

```{r eval=F}
# NOT run
cupcakes <- bake(pour(mix(ingredients)))
```

A computer has no trouble understanding this and your cupcakes will be made just
fine but a person has to read right to left to understand the order of operations 
- the opposite of how most western languages are read - making it harder to 
understand what is being done! 

To be more readable without pipes, we might break up this code into intermediate objects... 

```{r, eval = F}
## NOT run
batter <- mix(ingredients)
muffin_tin <- pour(batter)
cupcakes <- bake(muffin_tin)
```

but this can clutter our environment with a lot of variables that aren't very 
useful to us, and often are named very similar things (e.g. step, step1, step2...)
which can lead to confusion and those hard-to-track-down bugs. 

### Enter the pipe... 

The *pipe* makes it easier to read code because it lays out the operations left to right 
so each line can be read like a line of a recipe for the perfect data frame! 

Pipes take the input on the left side of the `%>%` symbol and pass it in as the 
first argument to the function on the right side.

With pipes, our cupcake example might be written like:

```{r, eval=F}
## NOT run
cupcakes <- ingredients %>% 
  mix() %>% 
  pour() %>% 
  bake()
```

**Pro Tip**: In RStudio the hotkey for the pipe is Ctrl + Shift + M. 

# `select` & Pipe (`%>%`)
Since the pipe grammar is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what 
we did above with the gapminder dataset using pipes:

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gap %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

First, we summon the gapminder data frame and pass it on to the next step using the pipe symbol `%>%`.
The second step is the `select()` function.
In this case we don't specify which data object we use in the call to `select()` since we've piped it in.

**Fun Fact**: There is a good chance you have encountered pipes before in the shell. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the shell it is `|.` But the concept is the same!

# `dplyr::filter`

Now let's say we're only interested in African countries. We can combine `select` and `filter` to select only the observations where `continent` is `Africa`.

```{r}
year_country_gdp_africa <- gap %>%
    filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
```

As with last time, first we pass the gapminder data frame to the `filter()` function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder data frame to the `select()` function.

To clarify, both the `select` and `filter` functions subsets the data frame. The difference is that `select` extracts certain *columns*, while `filter` extracts certain *rows*.

**Note:** The order of operations is very important in this case. If we used 'select' first, filter would not be able to find the variable `continent` since we would have removed it in the previous step.

# `dplyr` Calculations Across Groups

A common task you'll encounter when working with data is running calculations on different groups within the data. For instance, what if we wanted to calculate the mean GDP per capita for each continent?

In base R, you would have to run the `mean()` function for each subset of data:

```{r}
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Africa"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Americas"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Asia"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Europe"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Oceania"])
```

That's a lot of repetition! To make matters worse, what if we wanted to add these values to our original data frame as a new column? We would have to write something like this:

```{r}
gap$mean.continent.GDP <- NA

gap$mean.continent.GDP[gap$continent == "Africa"] <- mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Africa"])

gap$mean.continent.GDP[gap$continent == "Americas"] <- mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Americas"])

gap$mean.continent.GDP[gap$continent == "Asia"] <- mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Asia"])

gap$mean.continent.GDP[gap$continent == "Europe"] <- mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Europe"])

gap$mean.continent.GDP[gap$continent == "Oceania"] <- mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Oceania"])
```

You can see how this can get pretty tedious, especially if we want to calculate more complicated or refined statistics. We could use loops or apply functions, but these can be difficult, slow, or error-prone.

# `dplyr` split-apply-combine

The abstract problem we're encountering here is know as "split-apply-combine":

![](img/splitapply.png)

We want to *split* our data into groups (in this case continents), *apply* some calculations on each group, then  *combine* the results together afterwards.

Module 4 gave some ways to do split-apply-combine type operations using the `apply` family of functions, but `dplyr` offers a cleaner, more straight-forward solution to this problem specifically for data frames.

```{r}
# Want to remove the column we just made? -- there are two easy ways!
gap <- gap %>% select(-mean.continent.GDP) # drop a column with - 
# OR
gap$mean.continent.GDP <- NULL
```

# `dplyr::group_by`

We've already seen how `filter()` can help us select observations that meet certain criteria (in the above: `continent == "Europe"`). More helpful, however, is the `group_by()` function, which will essentially use every unique criteria that we could have used in `filter()`.

A `grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list` is a `data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular value `continent` (at least in the example above).

![](img/dplyr-fig2.png)

# `dplyr::summarize`

`group_by()` on its own is not particularly interesting.
It's much more exciting used in conjunction with the `summarize()` function. 
This will allow use to create new variable(s) by applying transformations to variables in each of the continent-specific data frames.
In other words, using the `group_by()` function, we split our original data frame into multiple pieces, which we then apply summary functions to (e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.
The output is a new data frame reduced in size, with one row per group.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents)
```

![](img/dplyr-fig3.png)

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent. But it gets even better -- the function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents_byyear)
```

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarize()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)
```

# `dplyr::mutate`

What if we wanted to add these values to our original data frame instead of creating a new object? For this, we can use the `mutate()` function, which is similar to `summarize()` except it creates new variables in the same data frame that you pass into it.

```{r}
gap_with_extra_vars <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    mutate(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
head(gap_with_extra_vars)
```

We can use also use `mutate()` to create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information. Note that `mutate()` does not need to operate on grouped data and it can do element-wise transformations.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gap %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)
```

# `mutate` vs. `summarize`

It can be confusing to decide whether to use `mutate` or `summarize`. The key distinction is whether you want the output to have one row for each group or one row for each row in the original data frame:

  - `mutate`: creates new columns with as many rows as the original data frame
  - `summarize`: creates a data frame with as many rows as groups

Note that if you use an aggregation function such as `mean()` within `mutate()` without using `groupby()`, you'll simply do the summary over all the rows of the input data frame.

And if you use an aggregation function such as `mean()` within `summarize()` without using `groupby()`, you'll simply create an output data frame with one row (i.e., the whole input data frame is a single group).

# `dplyr::arrange`

As a last step, let's say we want to sort the rows in our data frame according to values in a certain column. We can use the `arrange()` function to do this. For instance, let's organize our rows by `year` (recent first), and then by `continent`.

```{r}
gap_with_extra_vars <- gap %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    mutate(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop)) %>%
    arrange(desc(year), continent) # `desc()` puts things ins descending order
head(gap_with_extra_vars)
```

# `dplyr` Take-aways

* Human readable: the function names describe the action being done
* Piping: chain functions in a step-by-step way, rather than nesting

```{r}
# without pipes:
gap_with_extra_vars <- arrange(
    mutate(
      group_by(gap, continent, year),
      mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap)
      ),
    desc(year), continent)
```
* Facilitates split-apply-combine manipulations for data frames

# dplyr and "non-standard evaluation"

You may run across the term "non-standard evaluation". 
The use of data frame variables without quotes around them is an example of this.

Why is this strange?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gap %>% select(continent, year) %>% tail()
```

Compare it to:

```{r, eval = F}
gap[ , c('continent', 'year')]
gap[ , continent]
```

Because `continent` and `year` are not variables our current environment! dplyr does some fancy stuff behind the scenes to save us from typing the quotes.

This is fine if you have a data analysis workflow but if you want to write a function that, for example, selects an arbitrary set of columns, you'll run into trouble.

```{r, eval = F}
## here's a helper function that computes the mean of a variable, stratifying by a grouping variable
grouped_mean <- function(data, group_var, summary_var) {
  data %>%
    group_by(group_var) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(summary_var))
}
gap %>% grouped_mean(continent, lifeExp)
gap %>% grouped_mean('continent', 'lifeExp')
```

See the `rlang` or `seplyr` packages for how one can deal with this problem in this context of using functions. 

# Tidying Data

Even before we conduct analysis or calculations, we need to put our data into the correct format. The goal here is to rearrange a messy dataset into one that is **tidy**

The two most important properties of tidy data are:

1) Each column is a variable.
2) Each row is an observation.

Tidy data is easier to work with, because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices). It then becomes easy to manipulate, visualize, and model.

For more on the concept of *tidy* data, read Hadley Wickham's paper [here](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)

## Wide vs. Long Formats

> "Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." – Hadley Wickham

Tabular datasets can be arranged in many ways. For instance, consider the data below. Each data set displays information on heart rate observed in individuals across 3 different time periods. But the data are organized differently in each table.

```{r}
wide <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  time1 = c(67, 80, 64),
  time2 = c(56, 90, 50),
  time3 = c(70, 67, 101)
)
wide

long <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory", "Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory", "Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  time = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  heartrate = c(67, 80, 64, 56, 90, 50, 70, 67, 10)
)
long
```

**Question**: Which one of these do you think is the *tidy* format?

**Answer**: The first data frame (the "wide" one) would not be considered *tidy* because values (i.e., heartrate) are spread across multiple columns.

We often refer to these different structures as "long" vs. "wide" formats. In the "long" format, you usually have 1 column for the observed variable and the other columns are ID variables.

For the "wide" format each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. These can be either repeated observations over time, or observation of multiple variables (or a mix of both). In the above case, we had the same kind of data (heart rate) entered across 3 different columns, corresponding to three different time periods.

![](img/tidyr-fig1.png)

You may find data input may be simpler and some programs/functions may prefer the "wide" format. However, many of R’s functions have been designed assuming you have "long" format data.

# Tidying the Gapminder Data

Lets look at the structure of our original gapminder data frame:

```{r}
head(gap)
```

**Question**: Is this data frame **wide** or **long**?

**Answer**: This data frame is somewhere in between the purely 'long' and 'wide' formats. We have 3 "ID variables" (`continent`, `country`, `year`) and 3 "Observation variables" (`pop`, `lifeExp`, `gdpPercap`).

Despite not having ALL observations in 1 column, this intermediate format makes sense given that all 3 observation variables have different units. As we have seen, many of the functions in R are often vector based, and you usually do not want to do mathematical operations on values with different units.

On the other hand, there are some instances in which a purely long or wide format is ideal (e.g. plotting). Likewise, sometimes you'll get data on your desk that is poorly organized, and you'll need to **reshape** it.

# `tidyr`

Thankfully, the `tidyr` package will help you efficiently transform your data regardless of original format.

```{r}
# Install the "tidyr" package (only necessary one time)
# install.packages("tidyr") # Not Run

# Load the "tidyr" package (necessary every new R session)
library(tidyr)
```

# `tidyr::gather`

Until now, we've been using the nicely formatted original gapminder data set. This data set is not quite wide and not quite long -- it's something in the middle, but "real" data (i.e., our own research data) will never be so well organized. Here let's start with the wide format version of the gapminder data set.

```{r}
gap_wide <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_wide.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(gap_wide)
```

The first step towards getting our nice intermediate data format is to first convert from the wide to the long format.
The function `gather()` will 'gather' the observation variables into a single variable. This is sometimes called "melting" your data, because it melts the table from wide to long. Those data will be melted into two variables: one for the variable names, and the other for the variable values.

```{r}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
    gather(obstype_year, obs_values, 3:38)
head(gap_long)
```

Notice that we put 3 arguments into the `gather()` function:

1. the name the new column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`),
2. the name for the new amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`),
3. the indices of the old variables (`3:38`, signalling columns 3 through 38) that we want to gather into one variable. Notice that we don't want to melt down columns 1 and 2, as these are considered "ID" variables.

# `tidyr::select`

If there are a lot of columns or they're named in a consistent pattern, we might not want to select them using the column numbers.
It'd be easier to use some information contained in the names themselves.
We can select variables using:

* variable indices
* variable names (without quotes)
* `x:z` to select all variables between x and z
* `-y` to *exclude* y
* `starts_with(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that starts with `x`
* `ends_with(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that ends with `x`
* `contains(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`: all names that contain `x`

See the `select()` function in `dplyr` for more options.

For instance, here we do the same gather operation with (1) the `starts_with` function, and (2) the `-` operator:

```{r}
# with the starts_with() function
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
    gather(obstype_year, obs_values, starts_with('pop'),
           starts_with('lifeExp'), starts_with('gdpPercap'))
head(gap_long)

# with the - operator
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
  gather(obstype_year, obs_values, -continent, -country)
head(gap_long)
```

However you choose to do it, notice that the output collapses all of the measure variables into two columns: one containing new ID variable, the other containing the observation value for that row.

# `tidyr::separate`

You'll notice that in our long dataset, `obstype_year` actually contains 2 pieces of information, the observation type (`pop`, `lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`.

We can use the `separate()` function to split the character strings into multiple variables:

```{r}
gap_long_sep <- gap_long %>%
  separate(obstype_year, into = c('obs_type','year'), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
head(gap_long_sep)
```

If you didn't use `tidyr` to do this, you'd have to use the `strsplit` function and use multiple lines of code to replace the column in `gap_long` with two new columns. This solution is much cleaner.

# `tidyr::spread`

The opposite of `gather()` is `spread()`. It spreads our observation variables back out to make a wider table. We can use this function to spread our `gap_long()` to the original "medium" format.

```{r}
gap_medium <- gap_long_sep %>%
  spread(obs_type, obs_values)
head(gap_medium)
```

All we need is some quick fixes to make this dataset identical to the original `gap` dataset:

```{r}
gap <- read.csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
head(gap_medium)
head(gap)

# rearrange columns
gap_medium <- gap_medium[,names(gap)]
head(gap_medium)

# arrange by country, continent, and year
gap_medium <- gap_medium %>%
  arrange(country,continent,year)
head(gap_medium)
```

# What we just told you will become obsolete...

`gather` and `spread` are being replaced by `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` in
`tidyr 1.0.0`, which use ideas from the `cdata` package to make reshaping easier
to think about. In a future bootcamp, we'll migrate to those functions.

# Extra Resources

`dplyr` and `tidyr` have many more functions to help you wrangle and manipulate 
your data. See the  [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) for more.

There are some other useful packages in the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org):

* `ggplot2` for plotting (I'll cover this in module 8)
* `readr` and `haven` for reading in data
* `purrr` for working with lists and operations similar to the `apply` family introduced in Module 4. 
* `stringr`, `lubridate`, `forcats` for manipulating strings, dates, and factors, respectively
* many many more! Take a peak at the [tidyverse github page](https://github.com/tidyverse)...

**Pro Tip:** To install and load the core tidyverse packages (includes `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`, among others), try:
```{r, eval = F}
## NOT run
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

# Breakout

### `dplyr`

1. Use `dplyr` to create a data frame containing the median `lifeExp` for each continent

2. Use `dplyr` to add a column to the gapminder dataset that contains the total population of the continent of each observation in a given year. For example, if the first observation is Afghanistan in 1952, the new column would contain the population of Asia in 1952.

3. Use `dplyr` to add a column called `gdpPercap_diff` that contains the difference between the observation's `gdpPercap` and the mean `gdpPercap` of the continent in that year. Arrange the data frame by the column you just created, in descending order (so that the relatively richest country/years are listed first)

### `tidyr`

4. Subset the results from question #3 to select only the `country`, `year`, and `gdpPercap_diff` columns. Use tidyr put it in wide format so that countries are rows and years are columns.

Hint: you'll probably see a message about a missing grouping variable. If you don't want continent included, you can pass the output of problem 3 through `ungroup()` to get rid of the continent information.
